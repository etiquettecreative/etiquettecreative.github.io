We are leading a workshop at the first ever Design Your World Conference. The day long STEM conference for girls will be held in Arlington, TX on May 5, 2012. We are inviting 200 fourth and fifth grade girls, mostly Girl Scouts, to attend this exciting day at UTA. There will be:

* An opening session with First Female Private Astronaut, Anousheh Ansari
* STEM Activites (One hosted by Etiquette, called Tinkering with Microcontrollers)
* Speakers from the STEM industries
* Lab Tours around UTA (They have some pretty cool stuff there) and...
* A Closing Awards Ceremony where the Product Designer STEM Badges will be awarded to the girls who participate

We are so excited for the event launch. For this first iteration, we're helping out with marketing, promotion and registration for the event in addition to hosting the Tinkering with Microcontrollers workshop. Get more info over at [StemForGirls](http://stemforgirls.wordpress.com)
