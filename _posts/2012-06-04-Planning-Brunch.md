Most weekends, the planning team meets up for brunch to discuss the upcoming Electronic Fashion Camp and enjoy some quality food and friend time. Some extraordinary women are stepping up as leaders and we want give them props for their efforts. Keep an eye out and you might see us around. We meet Saturdays at noon and randomly during the week; if you want to join, [let us know](hello@etiquettecreative.org).
