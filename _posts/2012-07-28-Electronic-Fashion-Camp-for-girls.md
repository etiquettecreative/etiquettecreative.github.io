We are so excited that our very first Electronic Fashion Camp For Girls is right around the corner.  The Etiquette Creative planning team is meeting up today to discuss some very important last-minute details.  We are going today to pick out material and a few special ladies on the team are staying up late to sew a few Lilypads and LED's (light emitting diodes) into amazing projects to show at the camp.

We are lucky enough to get not one but three ladies to travel all the way from SparkFun Electronics in Boulder, Colorado. They are the eTextiles Expert, Dia, Arduino Programmer, Toni, and Education Department Representative, Mandi. Ladies, thank you so much for joining our fun!

The volunteers of Etiquette Creative come from a very diverse range of backgrounds. We have engineers from Raytheon and media experts from The University of Texas at Dallas. We even have a high school student from Austin, TX joining in on the fun.  We'll provide a complete list with a big Texas "Thank you" after the event.

The goal of the camp is to get girls excited about Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math (STEAM). Some of us prefer to say that we're going to play with blinky lights on purses and wrist bands; that's just as accurate and sounds a whole lot more fun!

Let us know if you have questions or need more information. We look forward to seeing you soon!
