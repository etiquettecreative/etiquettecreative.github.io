We visited [Oil & Cotton](http://www.oilandcotton.com/) last Saturday and it seems like a great space for what we are trying to accomplish. [Mary](http://www.twitter.com/maryeskinner), one of our design leads, took some quick pictures of the room we plan to use for the camp. The space has a great feel to it.

Oil & Cotton is a non-profit founded by instructors Shannon Driscoll and Kayli House Cusick with the mission of providing "creative space for education, exhibition, performance and exchange between the public and the art community." They have become a substantial part of the local Dallas art community and we can't wait to work with them.
