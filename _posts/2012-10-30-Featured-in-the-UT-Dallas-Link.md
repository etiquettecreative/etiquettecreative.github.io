On the last day of camp, we had a special visitor from the University of Texas at Dallas: Farah Ellenbogen. We sat down with her and spoke about the camp, our mission and our efforts. In turn, she wrote a great article about us for the UTD LINK. It talks a bit about our history and how we went about constructing the camp.

Thanks again to UT Dallas for their continuous support. Thanks Farah!
