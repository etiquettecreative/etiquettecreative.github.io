Join Etiquette Creative at 3:00pm on Sunday, June 24th for the Design Your World Electronic Fashion Camp volunteer workshop. Volunteers will have the chance to get to know each other while working to light up LEDs by learning the basics of sewing, circuit theory and coding with the LilyPad Arduino. Feel free to invite anyone else who may be interested. We'll bring the Arduino's if you bring your brains.

This workshop will be located in the UTD EMAC Classroom. Message [hello@etiquettecreative.org](mailto:hello@etiquettecreative.org) with questions.

Materials you can bring (not necessary to participate)

* Laptop installed with the [Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/hu/Main/Software), there are lots of examples
* Alligator Clips for prototyping if you have them.

[Email us](mailto:hello@etiquettecreative.org) to attend.
