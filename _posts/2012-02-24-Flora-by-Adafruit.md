Adafruit and Ladyada recently announced the new wearable microcontroller FLORA. While conceptually similar to Leah Buechley's LilyPad, its got an entirely new platform. Its got a variety of modules including "Bluetooth, GPS, 3-axis accelerometer, compass module, flex sensor, piezo, IR LED, push button, embroidered + capacitive keypad, OLED and more." Additional components make it very beginner-friendly. Even better, it's made right here in America.
